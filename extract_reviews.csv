    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD.

This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor).

Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.

    This is definitely a budget branded phone üì± after 1 month 22 days of use today I am posting this review.. I got this phone as a childrens day gift üéÅ from my father ‚ù§Ô∏èPros :-1. If you are a heavy user then the charge will be stay for 10 to 12 hours otherwise it's stay for almost 1 day..2. Very smooth touch no issue in typing or anything..3. The camera quality is awesome it's shows your original skin texture..4. The audio quality is also awesome5.  The video quality is just wow6. 5 g enable7. Clean UICons :-1. If you are a filter lover and do not like the original skin texture then this phone is not for you..2. This phone only have 1080p resolution3. Limited 5 g bands4. It doesn‚Äôt have HDR10+ support for Netflix and Amazon Prime, which means your viewing experience will always lag behind All in all

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace

    Performance up to the marküëç, If you do more gaming than average, this phone is definitely a must buy. But if you want to buy a camera centric phone you can look at other phones like Vivo and oppo. Rear camera is also very good but the selfie is little disappointing.

    I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.

    Absolutely the best smartphone with value for money. I am a fan of OnePlus and have always wanted to buy a phone. Finally, I got this one. I am delighted with this mobile. This battery backup is just excellent. with the standby screen time, you can use more than 9 hours. I didn't test by playing the games but, I am sure it will give a good experience. The camera quality is good and smoother. I am writing this review after using a month.

    I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.
